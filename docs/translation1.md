**C. Translation**

Chaos was the first of the gods.
His daughters were Nox, the mother of all, and Terra, the goddess Earth. **(This is nicely idiomatic, but the word order in Latin sugegsts that "moter of all" is attached to Earth, not Nox)**
This mother was the god of death and destruction. **What case do you think Mortis and Leti are in?**
His sons were horrible monsters: Typhon, Python, and Cyclopes
Typhon and Python were horrible dragons and Cyclopes was a foolish mason. **("Cyclopes" is actually plural from *Cyclops, Cyclopis*.  That should make it easier to understand the form of "fabri bruti.")**
But his brother Uranus was the first king of the Gods.
He was strong and large **(or "great")** but wise.
