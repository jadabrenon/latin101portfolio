When the Greeks weren't able to capture Troy for 10 years,
epeus made a wooden horse of amazing magnitude.
In it were gathered Menelaus, Ulixes, Domedes, Thessandwer, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thomas, Machaon, Neoptolemus.
And on the horse they wrote "The Greeks give a gift to Minerva," and they carried the military camps over to Tenedo.
When the trojans saw it, they judged that the enemies had gone away;
Priamus ordered the horse to be led to the temple of Minerva.
When the prophet, Cassandra, said that the horse contained the enemies,
 trust was not given to her and they placed the horse in front of the church.
The Greeks went out of the gate
and they killed the guards and conquered Troy.
