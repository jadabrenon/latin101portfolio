Erechtheus, the son of Pandionis, had four daughters. At that time, Eumolpus, son of Neptune, went to Athens to attack, but this is the way of life.  **Identify the form of *victus est*.**

Neptune, angry because the son was killed by Erecchtheus, said "the daughter was sacraficed by Erecthei."  **The gerundive does not make a factual statement.**
